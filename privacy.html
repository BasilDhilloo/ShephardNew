            <p class="firstPara C"> At its core, privacy is about control.</p>

            <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">And at Lucky Shepherd, we’re firm believers that you should have control over your own data and know 
                exactly how it’s being used.  By using this website, you implicitly grant us and our Partners the ability
                to access, use, and store the resulting data to give you the fully optimized user experience you are seeking.
                    Partners are trusted third parties who perform functions and provide services to us, including site hosting
                    and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, advertising, and direct marketing 
                    campaigns.  We ensure that each of these Partners executes a contract with Lucky Shepherd obligating them 
                    to securely store your information and respect your privacy.</p>

                What information do we collect via our website?
            </p>

            <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">
                Lucky Shepherd collects certain personal information in several ways and from several sources.  Specifically, our website collects the following:
            </p>
            <div class="pl-5 secondParaPadding">
              <p class="secondPara"  style="display: list-item;"> Personal Information: If you fill out a form, sign up for a newsletter, apply for a job, or otherwise contact us in any way, you may be asked to 
                provide certain information including your name, email address, physical address, and preferences.  If you do not want to share your Personal Information
                 with us, please don’t take any of the foregoing actions.
              </p>

              <p class="secondPara"  style="display: list-item;">Site Visit Information: Our website passively collects certain information each time you visit.  This may include information collected from cookies and other 
                common activity logging technologies, including your browser type, operating system, IP address, device specific data, certain search data, web-history data, and general statistics about your activities while 
                on our website.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">
                We use this Personal and Site Visit Information to contact you, provide an optimized experience, provide relevant information we believe may be of interest to you, including marketing ads, ensure our 
                website is working properly, and for other purposes consistent with the reason for which you shared your Personal Information.  Lucky Shepherd may also disclose your Personal or Site Visit Information
                 as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, warrant, or similar legally enforceable request for information.
            </p>

            <p class="fourthPara mt-4 secondParaPadding" style="text-align: left;"> Do we use cookies?</p>
            <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding"> Yes.  We use cookies to improve your experience on our site and to improve the relevance of any information you receive.  Lucky Shepherd uses persistent cookies.  These cookies stay in your browser and 
                allow us to recognize you when you return to our site.  We use these cookies to better understand how you use our site, diagnose and fix technical problems, and otherwise enhance our offerings.</p>

            <p class="fourthPara mt-4 secondParaPadding" style="text-align: left;">Can you access your personal information?</p>
            <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">If at any point in the future you create a Lucky Shepherd account, you can confirm, change or update the Personal Information you share with us by logging into your account or you can also ask us for help with changing or updating your information by contacting us at info@LuckyShepherd.io.</p>


            <p class="fourthPara mt-4 secondParaPadding" style="text-align: left;">Can you stop receiving our marketing messages?</p>
            <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">Lucky Shepherd may send you marketing messages, including marketing sent to you by email, or about our products and services, and to alert you to relevant opportunities.  You can stop receiving these messages at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of a Lucky Shepherd message.  Note that you cannot opt-out of receiving emails from us that are business related (for instance emails about an investment with us).</p>

            <p class="fourthPara mt-4 secondParaPadding" style="text-align: left;">Are we tracking your activity across other websites?</p>
            <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">Like many websites, we use select advertising Partners to “retarget” advertisements. Retargeting occurs when a select advertising Partner places a persistent cookie on your computer or mobile device to track your activities across other websites, and to improve the relevance of the advertisements you receive across the websites you visit.</p>
         
            <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">Also, when you visit our website, we automatically collect the name of the website you came from (called the “referring page”), and the name of the website you visited immediately after ours (called the “exit page”). This information is used exclusively to improve your experience on our website, and to increase the relevance of the advertisements you receive.</p>
            <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">Because we use persistent cookies, your selection of the “Do Not Track” option on your browser may not stop the cookies we use from collecting information about other websites you have visited. However, you may prevent our advertising Partners from tracking your activities by adjusting the settings in your browser so it rejects cookies or so it is set to “Do Not Track.” Please remember, we have no means of confirming or controlling whether our advertising Partners honor the “Do Not Track” browser settings.</p>
         
            <p class="fourthPara mt-4 secondParaPadding" style="text-align: left;">What about links to third-party sites?</p>
            <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">Our Lucky Shepherd website may contain links to third-party websites. We do not have control over the privacy policies of advertisers or other third-parties operating these websites. An advertiser or third-party may receive the information you enter into a form or survey contained in an advertisement. Any personal information you enter is provided directly to that third-party and is subject to that third-party’s privacy policy.</p>
          
            <p class="fourthPara mt-4 secondParaPadding" style="text-align: left;">How do we keep your information safe?</p>
            <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">Lucky Shepherd takes the security of your personal information very seriously. We use commercially reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to keep the personal information you share with us secure. Despite these safeguards and our reasonable efforts to secure your information, Lucky Shepherd cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third-parties won’t be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your personal information.</p>
           
            <p class="fourthPara mt-4 secondParaPadding" style="text-align: left;">Will we update this Privacy Policy?</p>
            <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our website and our information practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by posting a notice on our site with a link to our revised policy. We encourage you to periodically visit this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>

        <p class="fourthPara mt-4 secondParaPadding" style="text-align: left;">Will we sell your data?</p>
        <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">No. We will never sell your data. Ever.
          It’s that simple.</p>
       
        <p class="fourthPara mt-4 secondParaPadding" style="text-align: left;">So, why do even the “good guys” collect it?</p>
        <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">Data is fuel – the life blood of AI.  AI can’t exist without data and machine learning and deep learning can’t take place without large quantities of data.  The key is in 
          understanding that our business asset isn’t your data, it’s the resulting algorithms that we build upon that knowledge.</p>
        
        <p class="fourthPara mt-4 secondParaPadding" style="text-align: left;">You might be reading this thinking, “Yeah, but…” A few things to consider…</p>
        <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">It will be increasingly impossible not to share your data. It’s already being collected in public spaces, retailers, even street cams. Everything is fair game, as the world
           around us becomes ever-more connected and predictive in nature. Every aspect of our lives will be affected and augmented by technology.</p>
        <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">Simply stated, the future is about experiences and experiences require data. This is the main reason that, in the coming age, embracing this technology-based society will 
          be simultaneously preferred and inevitable for those of us in the developed world.</p>
        
        <p class="fourthPara mt-4 secondParaPadding" style="text-align: left;">Worried about all this data eroding your privacy?</p>
        <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">Maybe, but the advance of data-driven technology is also putting us more in control than ever before. Shop when and where you want, your personal preferences known.
           Customize your living environment, even when sharing your home with others. Enhance your personal security – physical, digital, and financial. Have the mundane tasks
            handled, leaving you free to live life to its fullest.</p>
        <p class="secondPara secondParaPadding">Certainly, the advance of data-driven technology requires more strength and engagement as an individual. Know when you are being marketed to – when to take advantage
           and when to ignore. Understand the difference between data sought for profit and that sought for control. Engage in open discussions about topics such as “future crimes”
            and citizen databases. Demand transparency in and a right to your own data.</p>

          <p class="firstPara secondParaPadding tealTeaText"> The same explosions in creativity that accompany our new data-driven world are fueling the rise of blockchain technology, 
            one of the most powerful tools for personal sovereignty we’ve ever seen. The horizon is bright. There have always been those fearful of technology – 
            of change – and those who have resisted it. Yet, in the end, the onward march of technological 
            progress always emerges victorious. So, maybe consider enjoying it along the way. Just remember – it should be your choice. </p>
